###### Missouri Civil War Museum
Each gallery and exhibit tells a different story of Missouri in the **American Civil War**, from guerrillas and jayhawkers to life on the home front.<br>
The Museum also contains several galleries on the **post-war era** and the history of our home here at Jefferson Barracks.
